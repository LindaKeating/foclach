## Foclach

A clone of octokatherine Word Master but slightly changed to allow Irish language players play the game using an Irish dictionary and Irish alphabet

ðŸ”— https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/


Which was heavily inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
## Rules

Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
